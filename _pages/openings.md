# Open positions

We are in the process of getting started at the University of Kansas - but we are always open to hear from driven, qualified biologists interested in working with us. The lab opens in August 2024.

<strong>PhD</strong>: We accept students through the <a href="https://molecularbiosciences.ku.edu/">Department of Molecular Biosciences</a> at the University of Kansas. 

<strong>Postdoc</strong>: Our lab opens in August 2024, but we hope to have positions for postdocs available within the first few months. If you are interested in our research and have a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology, Genetics, or a related field, please send a 1-page cover letter of your previous work and why you are interested in our lab, your CV, and the names and contact information of 3 academic references to Dr. Dalton.

<strong>Undergraduates</strong>: We highly value the work of undergrads - there are usually many opportunities to get involved in fruit fly science and contribute directly to research in the lab. Due to time constraints around research, we would require at least 10hrs each week, and we typically do not accept Seniors. Please fill out and email [this form]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/Undergrad_Questionnaire.pdf) to Dr. Dalton.
