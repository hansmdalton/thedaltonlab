- title: "A genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies DPM1 as a modifier of DPAGT1 deficiency and ER stress"
  image: PLOSGen_2022.png
  description: Using inhibitory drugs, we perform two cell-based screens with CRISPR technology to determine which genes are important under DPAGT1 inhibition. We then used a living fly, that models DPAGT1-CDG in the eye, in order to determine which of the top screened genes can improve its impaired eye development. Surprisingly, we found that inhibiting other CDG-causing genes, such as our top hit Dpm1, could improve our DPAGT1-CDG cell and fly models.

- title: "Decoupling of Apoptosis from Activation of the ER Stress Response by the Drosophila Metallopeptidase superdeath"
  image: Superdeath_2020.png
  description: Using Drosophila, this study provides evidence that superdeath is a link between stress in the ER and activation of cytosolic apoptotic pathways.

  image: PLOSGen_2018.png
  description: We exposed developmental and adult life stages of C. elegans to airborne nano-sized particulate matter (nPM) produced by traffic emissions and measured biological and molecular endpoints that changed in response.

- title: "Redirection of SKN-1 abates the negative metabolic outcomes of a perceived pathogen infection"
  image: PLOSGen_2018.png
  description: The transcription factor SKN-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of mammalian NRF2, mediates cytoprotective responses to diverse stresses to restore cellular homeostasis. We have discovered that pathogen exposure drives the rapid loss of somatic lipids in a SKN-1â€“dependent manner.
